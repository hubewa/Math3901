\textbf{Conditional Probability discrete case}\\
The conditional expectation of $X$ given by $Y = y$ is defined by

$$\mathbb{E}(X|Y = y) = \sum_{x \in S_x} x p_{X|Y} (x|y)$$

\textbf{Conditional probability density function}\\

The conditional probability density function of $X$ given $Y = y$ is defined for all values $y$ such that $f_Y(y) > 0$ by 

$$f_{X|Y}(x,y) = \frac{f_{XY}(x,y)}{f_Y(y)}$$

Marginal density is defined as
$$\mathbb{P}(y-\delta/2 \leq Y \leq y + \delta/2) \approx \delta f_Y(y)$$

\textbf{Law of iterred expectations}\\
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables. Then:

$$\mathbb{E}(X) = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}(X|Y)]$$

$\mathbb{E}(X)$ is the weighted average of the conditional expected values of $X$ given $Y=y$, each of the terms $\mathbb{E}(X|Y=y)$ being weighted by the probability of the event on which it is conditioned.\\

This also satisfies:\\

$$\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}(X|Y)g(Y)] = \mathbb{E}(Xg(Y))$$

for any function $g$ where both expectations exist.\\

\textbf{Conditional Variance}\\
The conditional variance of a random variable $X$ given that $Y = y$ is given by

$$Var(X|Y=y) = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mathbb{E}(X|Y=y))^2|Y=y]$$

All properties of Variance hold here.\\

\textbf{Conditional variance formula}\\
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables. Then

$$Var(X) = \mathbb{E}[Var(X|Y) + Var[\mathbb{E}(X|Y)]] $$

\textbf{Iterred Conditonal expectation}\\
$$\mathbb{E}(X|Y) = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}(X|W,Y)|Y]$$

where $\mathbb{E}(X|W,Y)$ is a random variable $\mathbb{E}(X|W=w, Y=y)$\\
